# Rewrite the grade program from the previous chapter using a function called computegrade that takes a score as its parameter and returns a grade as a string.

        grade = 'A'
    elif score >= 0.8 :

        grade = 'C'
    elif score >= 0.6 :
        grade = 'D'
    elif score < 0.6:
        grade = 'F'
